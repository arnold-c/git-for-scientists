# Basic Git Workflow

In this section, we'll put together the basic Git workflow, and show how all these many terms and commands actually fit together.
We'll start completely from scratch, and work our way up to a full-fledged Git repository.
I find that this is the best way to learn anything is to actually do it on a real project, as it's hard to conceptualize what's going on when you're just reading about it, or even working through a toy example.
And because we research infectious diseases in CIDD, we'll build up a repository that contains a notebook for an SIR model (Susceptible-Infected-Recovered), and do it in both Python and R as that should allow most people to follow along with the code in a language they're familiar with.

## Creating a New Repository

We'll create a new repository on GitHub, and then clone it to our local machine.
We'll follow the steps outlined in the [GitHub First section](making-your-first-repo.qmd#github-first).
So, in summary:

1. On your computer, decide where you want to store all your git repositories, and create a folder for them
    - Mine has the path `~/Documents/Repos/`, but you can put it wherever you want
2. Create a new repository on GitHub, and name it `sir-model`
    - Make sure you inialize it with a README, Description, R/Python `.gitignore` template (depending on the language you'd like to follow along with), and an MIT license
3. Open GitKraken
4. Open the "Clone" window using `cmd+N`/`ctrl+N`
5. Click on the "GitHub" button and select the `sir-model` repository
    - Make sure the clone path is set to the folder you created in step 1
6. Click "Clone" and wait for the repository to be cloned to your computer

The repo should now be cloned to your computer, and you should be able to see it in the "Local" section of GitKraken, which you can access using `cmd+O`/`ctrl+O`.
