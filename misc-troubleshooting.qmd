# Miscellaneous

This section contains miscellaneous troubleshooting information that does not have a natural home elsewhere, at the moment.

## Partial Push

Sometimes you make a lot of **commits** locally that you haven't pushed to the **remote**.
If this happens, occasionally, you may want to push only a subset of the commits to the **remote**.
This could be because you're not sure that all of the commits are complete enough to be shared, and you may want to edit them later on.
It could also be that you tried a regular push, but it failed, and pushing only a subset of the commits is a way to troubleshoot the problem.

```bash
git push origin commit-id:branch-name
```
