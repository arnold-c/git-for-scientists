# Welcome, and what this book is about {.unnumbered}

This book accompanies the Center for Infectious Disease Dynamics short workshop on using Git and GitHub as researchers.
The content will mirror much of the workshop's syllabus, and act as a reference for attendees (and others), although I would highly recommend reading through the excellent book https://happygitwithr.com by Jenny Bryan and co.
