# Welcome, and what this book is about {.unnumbered}

This book accompanies the Center for Infectious Disease Dynamics short workshop on using Git and GitHub as researchers.
The content will mirror much of the workshop's syllabus, and act as a reference for attendees (and others), although I would highly recommend reading through the [excellent book](https://happygitwithr.com) by Jenny Bryan and co., as well as the [GitHub docs](https://docs.github.com/en) for more in-depth information.
I also strongly recommend looking at the [Atlassian Git tutorials](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials) for excellent in-depth tutorials about git, and [Learn Git Branching](https://learngitbranching.js.org) for an interactive way to learn git!
