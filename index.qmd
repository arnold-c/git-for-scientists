# Welcome, and what this book is about {.unnumbered}

This book accompanies the Pennsylvania State University's Center for Infectious Disease Dynamics short workshop on using Git and GitHub as researchers.
The content will mirror much of the workshop's syllabus, and act as a reference for attendees (and others), although I would highly recommend reading through the [excellent book](https://happygitwithr.com) by Jenny Bryan and co., as well as the [GitHub docs](https://docs.github.com/en) for more in-depth information.
I also strongly recommend looking at the [Atlassian Git tutorials](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials) for excellent in-depth tutorials about git, and [Learn Git Branching](https://learngitbranching.js.org) for an interactive way to learn git!

## Motivation

As mentioned above, there are plenty of great resources out there for learning git and GitHub.
So why write another one?
Well, in part, I wanted to try and consolidate the information out there without a bias and focus on R and R-studio, which many of the more introductory resources do, and without getting too deep into the weeds like some of the resources aimed at software developers rather than busy researchers.

## Pre-requisites

There are some pre-requisite tasks to get set up ahead of the workshop.

1. What are git and GitHub, and why do I care?
2. How to install Git
3. Setting up a GitHub account
4. Connecting GitHub to my machine

## TOC

After getting setup, the workshop will cover the following sections:

1. An overview of how git works
2. Making your first git repository
3. Git mechanics - how to actually use git
4. Git branching
5. Recommended practices
